The notebooks available on <a href="https://edenlibrary.ai">Eden library</a> show our modest contribution to the deep learning community interested in precision agriculture problems. They synthesize some of the most common agricultural problems and solutions we have addressed in the past years. It is important to remark that the notebooks have not been finely tuned for showing the best possible results; they just present ways to use the datasets for basic tasks. If you want to know more about the use of notebooks as a development tool, please, check this link: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html

### Which technologies are mainly used?
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* OpenCV
* Scikit-learn
* Auto-sklearn
* AutoKeras
* Pytorch

### Will new notebooks be created?
Definitely **yes**! We will update the notebook section with new notebooks implementing novel (and traditional) techniques related to deep learning  and image processing which can be directly applied to datasets extracted from the Eden library (and similar ones). If you want to take a general view of the availble notebooks, click on the next image:

### Will current notebooks be updated?
For sure. The notebooks published in the Eden platform are open for extension with additional information, bibliography, and new pieces of source code which could improve the readability of the explained techniques. **If you have any suggestions** for improving them or any doubts to be clarified, do not hesitate to **open an issue in the Github repo**. We will reply to you as soon as possible.

### Notebook Structure
All notebooks have a quite similar structure:
1. Instructions for running it. Take care of the dependencies!
2. Theoretical background and agricultural context.
3. Code ready for being executed.
